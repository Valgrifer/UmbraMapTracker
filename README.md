# UmbraMapTracker

**UmbraMapTracker** is a map tracking plugin for [Umbra](https://github.com/una-xiv/umbra), heavily inspired by and based on [SimpleMapTracker](https://github.com/Caraxi/SimpleMapTracker).  
It provides the same functionality as SimpleMapTracker while adding enhanced integration and additional features designed for group play and marker management.

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ **Track map objectives easily** – identical to the original SimpleMapTracker functionality.
- 👥 **Team Map Widget** – new UI widget that displays tracked maps for your entire party.
- 📍 **World Marker Support** – automatically shows world markers related to tracked maps.



I will try to look into the original [SimpleMapTracker](https://github.com/Caraxi/SimpleMapTracker) project to add IPC.
